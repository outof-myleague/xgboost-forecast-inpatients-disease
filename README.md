This project uses the XGBoost algorithm to forecast the **top 10 most frequent inpatient diseases**, based on hospital admission data. The goal is to support healthcare management in predicting disease trends and optimizing hospital resources.

## Dataset
 `common_diseases.csv` is the main dataset used in this project. It contains daily historical records of inpatient cases grouped by ICD-10 disease codes.

 ## Dashboard Output
The final output of this research is the file  `dashboard_predicted.py`. A dashboard that visualizes the predicted trends of the top 10 inpatient diseases for the next 12 months.
